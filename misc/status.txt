Kali: I have Kali and VMWare set up on my personal laptop (Windows). I would like to complain though because it took me around 2 hours and I was very confused,
The initial steps had no explanation and I had a hard time downloading VMWare because the instructions didn't match my display (I got to the buying screen by 
accident and then had to completely redo it again). I wasn't expecting it to take nearly this long. I don't know if I'm just particularly bad at this or if 
my computer is just very slow, but a warning on how long this would take would have been nice because I kept having to leave to do other things which meant 
I was more confused when I came back. If I had known it would take this long I would've scheduled it better, but I assumed since downloads are usually 
easy that it wouldn't take more than 15 minutes to get everything up and running.
