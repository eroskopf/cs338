===== DAYTIME =====
1) Parts of the TCP 3-way handshake by listing the frame summaries of the relevant frames


2) What port number does the client (i.e. nc on your Kali computer) use for this interaction? And why does the client need a port?


3) What frame contains the actual date and time? (Show the frame summary as in question 1 above.)


4) What is the full content (not counting the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers) of the frame? What do each of the pieces of the frame content represent? 
(Most of the frame content is things like the year, month, day, hour, etc., but there's a little more info, too.)


5) What does [SYN] mean?
Sync, syncronize, so that both the client and the server are on the same page and know what is happening. 

6) What does [ACK] mean?
Acknowedge, the client or the server acknowledges that it received the information or the request.

7) What does [FIN] mean?
Finished, or finishing up. It's when the client and the server are confirming that they're both done with the interaction.

8) Which entity (the nc client or the daytime server) initiated the closing of the TCP connection? How can you tell?
The daytime server initiated the closing of the connection because it's the first entity to respond with a [FIN]

===== HTTP =====
1) How many TCP connections were opened?


2) Can you tell where my homepage (index.html) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.) 


3) Can you tell where my photograph (jeff_square_head.jpg) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, 
include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)
